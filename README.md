# Students_Performance


# Introduction

>This exercise aims to fit a model able to predict the math score from a sample of 1000 students based on sociodemographics features, and other quantitative metrics such us the results from other tests. For this popouse  we obtain the dataset from  kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams). 

## Excercise Premises

* We want to predict the column 'math score' using Neural Networks.
* We must use a Deep Learning framework for this exercise as Keras.
* We should split the dataset in train/test to verify your results.

## Base
* CRAN R 3.5.2
* IDE  RSTUDIO
* Libraries: Data Wrangling (DPLYR, RESHAPE2, DUMMY), Visualization(GGPLOT2), Deep Learning(KERAS), Validation(ROCR)
